# Code Explanation

## 1. `initializeGame` Function

```javascript
function initializeGame(playerName1, playerName2, difficulty) {  
  let generatedPuzzle = generateSudokuPuzzle(1);
  initializePlayers();
  setPlayerNames(playerName1, playerName2);
  // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

### Explanation
The `initializeGame` function is a central part of the Sudoku game, setting up the initial state based on user inputs. It takes two player names and a difficulty level as parameters. The function begins by generating a new Sudoku puzzle through `generateSudokuPuzzle`, which is influenced by the selected difficulty level. Then, it initializes the players' states using `initializePlayers` and assigns the names provided to each player using `setPlayerNames`. This function ensures that each game session starts with a fresh board and personalized settings.

## 2. `togglePlayer` Function

```javascript
function togglePlayer() {
  // ... code to handle timer and UI updates ...
  switchPlayer();
  // ... additional code ...
}
```

### Explanation
The `togglePlayer` function is crucial for the turn-based nature of the multiplayer Sudoku game. It's responsible for switching the active player once a turn is completed. Internally, it calls `switchPlayer`, which toggles the `currentPlayer` variable between the two players. This function also handles UI updates to reflect whose turn it is and manages the timer for each player. It plays a key role in ensuring the game progresses smoothly and that each player gets their turn.

## 3. `removeCells` Function

```javascript
const removeCells = (grid, difficulty) => {
    // ... code to remove cells based on difficulty ...
};
```

### Explanation
The `removeCells` function dynamically alters the Sudoku grid's complexity according to the chosen difficulty level. It receives the game grid and a difficulty parameter, removing a varying number of cells from the grid based on this difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the more cells are removed, making the puzzle more challenging to solve. This function is pivotal in adapting the game to different skill levels, ensuring a suitable challenge for all players.
