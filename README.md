## How to Play

### Steps to Play Sudoku Showdown
1. **Start the Game**: Open `index.html` in a live server environment to launch the game.
2. **Enter Player Details**: Players enter their names and select the difficulty level, which determines the number of pre-filled cells on the board.
3. **Begin the Match**: Click the 'Start Game' button to begin playing with the selected settings.
4. **Gameplay**: Players alternate turns, filling in the Sudoku grid. Each turn is timed.
5. **Scoring Points**: Points are scored for correct entries, with penalties for incorrect guesses.
6. **Keep an Eye on the Timer**: If a player's timer runs out, their turn ends automatically.
7. **Objective**: Complete the Sudoku board with the highest score. The game ends when the board is filled or a player's timer runs out.
8. **Declaring a Winner**: The game concludes when the board is full or a timer expires. The player with the highest score wins.

## Point System

### Earning and Losing Points
- **Correct Entry**: +100 points for each correct entry.
- **Incorrect Entry**: -50 points as a penalty for an incorrect entry.
- **Valid Entry Not in Final Solution**: +80 points for an entry that's correct based on the current board state but not part of the final solution.
- **Strategic Play**: Points system encourages strategic thinking â€“ players must balance speed with accuracy.

### Difficulty Levels
- **Difficulty Selection**: The difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) affects the number of pre-filled cells on the board. Easier levels have more pre-filled cells, while harder levels have fewer, requiring more input from players.

## Game Logic

### Game Termination
- The game concludes once the entire board is filled.
- Alternatively, the game can end if a player's timer expires.

### Penalties
- Invalid moves lead to a loss of turn and point deduction.
- Exceeding a 4-minute limit for a turn will trigger an automatic switch to the next player.
