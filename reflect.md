# Code Explanation for Sudoku Game

## 1. Creating the Board (Including Removing Cells)

### Code Snippet
```javascript
const initGameGrid = (puzzle) => {
  // ... code to create the grid ...
  removeCells(grid, difficulty);
};

const removeCells = (grid, difficulty) => {
  // ... code to remove cells based on difficulty ...
};
```

### Explanation
The `initGameGrid` function plays a crucial role in setting up the Sudoku game board. It takes a `puzzle` (a 2D array representing the Sudoku grid) as an input and initializes the game's visual grid. Each cell of the grid is created as a `div` element and appended to the main grid container in the DOM.

Within `initGameGrid`, the `removeCells` function is called, which modifies the initial complete puzzle to create the actual game challenge. The `removeCells` function takes the grid and the selected difficulty level as parameters. Based on the difficulty, it randomly removes a certain number of cells from the grid, leaving them empty for the player to fill. The removal process involves setting these cells' values to an unassigned state. The difficulty level determines how many cells are removed, with higher difficulties resulting in more cells being emptied, thus increasing the game's challenge.

## 2. Checking the Win Condition

### Code Snippet
```javascript
const isBoardSolved = (grid) => {
  // ... logic to check if the board is solved ...
};
```

### Explanation
The `isBoardSolved` function is critical for determining the end of the game. It checks whether the current state of the Sudoku board is a valid and complete solution. This function iterates through the grid and verifies that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. A successful check indicates that the player has correctly completed the puzzle, triggering the win condition. This function ensures the integrity of the game by validating the correctness of the player's solution.

## 3. Toggle Player

### Code Snippet
```javascript
function togglePlayer() {
  // ... code to switch the current player and manage timers ...
}
```

### Explanation
In the multiplayer setup of the Sudoku game, the `togglePlayer` function is essential for alternating turns between players. Each time a player completes their turn, this function is called to switch the active player. It updates the `currentPlayer` variable to reflect who is currently playing.

Additionally, `togglePlayer` manages each player's timer, stopping the timer for the player who just completed their turn and starting the timer for the next player. This ensures fair play by providing each player with equal and limited time to make their moves. The function also handles necessary UI updates to indicate which player's turn it is, enhancing the game's interactive experience.
